1. Make a website for psv3 (maybe psv3.org? or psv3.noop.us?)
	- make sure to inclue inline installation!
		(https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/inline_installation)
2. Add a welcome page?
	- normies won't understand how to use it without constant guidance

3. Update the popup menu
	- it could look so sick, I'm thinking maybe an underwater theme.

4. Make it actually work
	- fix up the code (see comments)

5. Finish deleting all of the PracticeIt-related code. This is only for bypassing the filter now.
